# Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to explore the concept of bias in data using articles about cities in different U.S. states, which we could obtain from Wikipedia. In order to investigate further, we would combine the dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of state populations, and use ORES (a machine learning service) to estimate the quality of the articles about the cities.

The analysis will consists of three parts:

**The states with the greatest and least coverage of cities on Wikipedia compared to their population.**

**The states with the highest and lowest proportion of high quality articles about cities.**

**A ranking of US geographic regions by articles-per-person and proportion of high quality articles.**
